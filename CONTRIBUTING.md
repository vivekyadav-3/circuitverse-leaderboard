## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Finding Issues

- Browse our [open issues](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/community-dashboard/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginner-friendly tasks
- Check for issues labeled `help wanted` for priority tasks

### Claiming an Issue

#### To claim an issue:

Comment on the issue with:

```
@bot claim
```

The bot will automatically assign you to the issue if:

- ✅ The issue is not already assigned to someone else
- ✅ You don't have any other open issues assigned to you

#### To unclaim an issue:

If you can no longer work on an issue, comment:

```
@bot drop
```

This will remove you from the issue and make it available for others.

#### Rules

| Rule                         | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One issue at a time**      | You can only be assigned to one open issue at a time. Complete or unclaim your current issue before claiming a new one. |
| **First come, first served** | Issues are assigned to the first person who claims them.                                                                |
| **In Progress label**        | When assigned, the issue automatically gets the `in progress` label.                                                    |

### Contributing Without an Issue

For small fixes (typos, minor improvements), you can submit a PR directly. For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss your approach.

## 📝 Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Sync your fork** with the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

2. **Create a feature branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

3. **Make your changes** and test them locally

4. **Run linting and tests:**

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### Submitting Your PR

1. Push your branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

3. Fill out the PR template with:
   - A clear description of what changes you made
   - Reference to the issue it addresses (e.g., `Fixes #123`)
   - Screenshots/recordings for UI changes

### PR Review Process

- PRs require approval from at least one maintainer
- Address any feedback promptly
- Keep your PR focused - one feature/fix per PR
- Keep your PR small when possible
